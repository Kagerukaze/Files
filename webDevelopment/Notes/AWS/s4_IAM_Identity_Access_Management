        Access Key Id - 
        Secret Access Key - can only be seen once
    
    2. I AM Console Password from AWS Management Console (I AM User)

** I AM Best Practices **
    - lock away AWS root user access keys
    - use groups to assing permissions
    - Use AWS defined policies when possible
    - Grant least privilege
    - Configure strong password policy for users
    - Enable MFA for ALL users
    - Use roles for applications that run on AWS EC2 instances
    - rotate credentials regularly
    - remove unnecessary credentials
    - Use policy condition for extra Security
    - monitor activity in your AWS Account
